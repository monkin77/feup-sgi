## Project information

The scene is based on the famous video-game character Lara Croft, inspired by the original game from 1996.
The character is displayed in a temple, a very iconic theme across the Tomb Raider games.

This project is the continuation of the previous one (`tp1`). The main objective was to explore some more advanced techniques, namely: **NURBS**, **Shaders**, and **Animations**.

### Main New Features:
- Robust parser capable of analyzing a XML and subsequently displaying the scene described in it.
  - Added support for specifying the 'w' property of each control point in the NURBS. If not specified, it is assumed to be 1.
- Base WebGL primitives powering the developed scenes.
- Effort to make the code organized and as modular as possible.
- Scene capable of properly displaying the project's features.
- The code is regularly documented.
- Interface folder to toggle the `highlighted` property of components.
- Scene
  - Inspired by the 1996 Tomb Raider.
  - Focused on the main charater, Lara Croft.
  - Displays an ancient temple full of pillars.
  - Makes use of several textures to recreate the aspect of the original game.
  - Secondary ambient inspired by the `Nether` world from Minecraft, activated by pressing the `m` key.
  - Added components using the created NURBS, such as the **Barrels**, the **Tent**, and the **Poster** in the wall.
- Animations
  - TODO

## Issues/Problems

- We think we did everything in the specification. However, we were afraid of certain scenarios where the parser could supposedly be more robust instead of displaying an error and aborting.
- The Lara Croft's animation was pretty challenging due to the complexity of the movement and the fact that we had to make it look relatively natural.
- The shader highlight animation is not very efficient if applied to many objects at once.
